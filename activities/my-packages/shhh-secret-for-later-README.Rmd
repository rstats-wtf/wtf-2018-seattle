## Workshop challenge checklist

*As you complete tasks, you can ~~cross them out~~ by surrounding with `~~`.*

* Have a look around the files here. Where are the R scripts? What are the directories `data` and `figs` for?
* Notice that this README is an `.Rmd` file. That means it could contain R code and will need to be rendered to create `README.md`.
* Open [R/01_write-installed-packages.R](R/01_write-installed-packages.R). Write the script as directed. Run it. Commit and push the current state.
* Open [R/02_wrangle-packages.R](R/02_wrangle-packages.R). Fill in the missing pieces of the script as directed. Run it. Commit and push the current state.
* Open [R/03_barchart-packages-built.R](R/03_barchart-packages-built.R). Fill in the missing pieces of the script as directed. Run it. Commit and push the current state.
* Fill in the blanks below in this README, using the results stored elsewhere.
* If you get this far, write an R script to run the whole analysis and, perhaps, another script that does a `make clean` style reset.

## Overview

The goal of packages-report is to FINISH THIS SENTENCE.

```{r, include = FALSE}
## load data/add-on-packages-freqtable.csv here in this chunk
```

I have `FILL THIS IN!!!` add-on packages installed.

Here's how they break down in terms of which version of R they were built under, which is related to how recently they were updated on CRAN.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## print the frequency table here
## make it prettier if you know how
```

### Flow of the analysis

*If you have time, document the analysis works, using internal links.*
